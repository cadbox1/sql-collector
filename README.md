# SQL Collector

This was an experiment to parse where conditions into a Java array

The idea is that SQL should be the source of truth since it is ubiquitous across backends and you can get near realtime feedback if you write the query in a database client. As opposed to Java where turnaround times can be in the order of minutes.
